        Got another mouth to feed
        <p>Leave her with the baby sitter <p>mama, call the grave digger
        <p>Gone <p>with <p>the <p>fallen <p>leaves
        <p>Am I coming out of left field?</div>

        Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now

        We could fight a <p>war for peace
        Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
        <p>Give into that easy living
        Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
        <p>Stop fighting for my enemies
        We could wave until the walls come down
        Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
        <p>It's <p>time <p>to <p>give <p>a <p>little <p>tip
        <p>Kids in the middle, move more 'til it falls
        Don't bother me

    <div>
        Is it coming?
        <p>Is it coming?
