    <div>Can't <p>keep <p>my hands <p>to myself
    <p>Think I'll dust'em off, put'em back up on the <p>shelf
    <p>In case my little baby girl is in need
    <p>Am I coming out of left field?</div>

    <div>Ooh woo <p>I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
    <p>I been feeling it since 1966, now
    <p>Might be over now, but I feel it still
    <p>Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
    <p>Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
    <p>Might be over now, but I feel it still</div>

    <div>Got another mouth to feed
    <p>Leave her with the baby sitter <p>mama, call the grave digger
    <p>Gone <p>with <p>the <p>fallen <p>leaves
    <p>Am I coming out of left field?</div>

    <div>Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
    <p>I been feeling it since 1966, now
    <p>Might be over now, but I feel it still
    <p>Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
    <p>Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
    <p>Might be over now, but I feel it still</div>

    <div>We could fight a <p>war for peace
    Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
    <p>Give into that easy living
    Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
    <p>Stop fighting for my enemies
    We could wave until the walls come down
    Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
    <p>It's <p>time <p>to <p>give <p>a <p>little <p>tip
    <p>Kids in the middle, move more 'til it falls
    Don't bother me</div>

    <div>Is it coming?
    <p>Is it coming?
    <p>Is it coming?
    <p>Is it coming?
    <p>Is it coming?
    <p>Is it coming back?</div>

    <div>Ooh woo <p>I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
    <p>Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse,
    Might be over now, but I feel it still</div>

    <div>Ooh woo <p>I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
    <p>I been feeling it since 1966, now
    <p>Might be over now, but I feel it still
    <p>Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
    <p>Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
    <p>Might be over now, but I feel it still
    <p>Might've had your fill, but <p>you feel it still</div>
